# GOAL
# Running a WIn32 GUI applications inside a Docker container on a Windows host using Docker Desktop 
# with WSL2 and X11 forwarding allow you to run Linux containers while forwarding the GUI to your Windows host.
# 
#   BEFORE executing the compose Docker command make sure you have read 'howto_create_a_dev_container.md' in the Howtos folder

networks:

# Define a network where the container has a fixed IP address
# bridge does not work on Docker Desktop(DD) with Windows containers, but works fine under DD with Linux containers
#
# When in the same network, using both the same 'nat' and 'bridge' setting, containers can communicate with each other via their
# the service names (x11_network-fixed in this case) or IP address, no port mappings needed for inter-container communication.
#
# You can replace 'nat', 'bridge' with 'overlay' which is meant for production clusters, load balancing (Docker Swarm or Kubernetes 
# deployments) For simple, local setups where multi-host communication is not needed, using overlay might be overkill.
# 
# See the file: '.env' for the variables
# docker network create external-example
