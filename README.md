# What
A Docker Template Stack Container for **Cross-Compiling Win32** GUI Projects.
The output of the GUI application is forwarded from the Linux container to the X11 server on the host (**XLaunch**). Win32 C applications can be created using the MinGW API. Additionally, the GUI application can be run in Linux by utilizing the **Wine** environment, and the output from Wine is forwarded to the X11 server on the Windows host.

While this is designed as a cross-compiling Win32 environment, nothing stops you from using it for other (GUI) application development!

**Available Sub Containers**
- Win32 C project environment

> ### Preview Markdown Files(.md)
>
>To preview the Markdown (.md) files in this project, one of the best solutions is to open these files in Visual Studio Code (VSC) and install the plugin: **Markdown Preview GitHub Styling** (Tested with version 2.04). Other plugins, or plugins for other programs, may not always work correctly with the file links in the documentation. I use the file link syntax supported by GitHub (Jekyll), which is also compatible with the above-mentioned plugin.
